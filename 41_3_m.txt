# left of this car will collide with the left to right moving car. Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong,

# If we consider each car as a point on a number line, the cars moving left to right can be considered as positive integers

# represented as -1, -2, -3.

# Therefore, we need to find out the number of pairs of positive and negative integers whose sum is zero.
# This can be done by creating a set of positive integers and checking if the negative of each integer is present in the set.

# First, let's consider the case where there are only two cars going in opposite directions.
# If the distance between them is d and their speed is v, then they will collide after d/v time units.
# Now consider the case with n cars going in each direction. We can pair up each car going in one direction
# with the closest car going in the opposite direction. The distance between each pair is d = (2n - 1) * v, where
# v is the speed of each car. Therefore, each pair will collide after (2n - 1) * v time units. Since all pairs
# are colliding simultaneously, the total number of collisions is simply the number of pairs, which is n.

# We also represent the collision point as C1, C2, C3
# The cars are initially far from each other, so we can assume that each car is at position 0
# At time t, the cars will be at positions t, 2t, 3t (for L1, L2, L3) and -t, -2t, -3t (for R1, R2, R3)
# The collision points will be at positions 0, 0, 0 (for C1, C2, C3)
# We can see that a collision will occur between Li and Ri if and only if Li + Ri = 0
# In other words, if Li = -Ri
# So the problem reduces to finding how many pairs of Li and Ri satisfy this condition

# We can solve this problem by using a set to keep track of the values of Ri that we have seen
