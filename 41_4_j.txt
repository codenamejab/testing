    # Since each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left, 
    # the total number of collisions will be n * n.
    return n * n

start of this response: 
The number of collisions would be equal to the number of pairs of cars moving in opposite directions. Since each car moving from left to right will eventually collide with each car moving from right to left, the total number of collisions would be n*n = n^2.

Therefore, the function can be written as:

    return n * n

start of this response: 
The number of collisions will be the product of the number of cars moving in each direction. So, the result will be n times n, or n squared.

    return n * n

start of this response: 
For each car moving in one direction, there will be a collision with a car moving in the opposite direction. Since there are n cars moving in each direction, there will be n collisions. So, the function simply returns n. 

Here is the Python code for the function:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n
```

start of this response: 
The number of collisions will be equal to the number of pairs of cars, one from each set. Since there are n cars in each set, the number of pairs (and thus collisions) will be n.

So, the function simply returns the input number n.

    return n


start of this response: 
The number of collisions will be equal to the number of cars in either direction. As each car moving left to right will collide with a car moving right to left, there will be n collisions. 

So, the function can simply return the input n.

    return n

start of this response: 
The number of collisions is simply the number of cars traveling in one direction multiplied by the number of cars traveling in the opposite direction. Since there are n cars traveling in each direction, the total number of collisions is n^2. Therefore, the function should return n^2. 

Here is the function that computes the number of collisions:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n*n
```

start of this response: 
The number of collisions is equal to the number of pairs of cars, one from each direction. Since there are n cars in each direction, the number of pairs (and therefore collisions) is simply n.

    return n

start of this response: 
The number of collisions can be calculated by simply multiplying the number of cars moving in one direction by the number of cars moving in the other direction. This is because each car moving in one direction will collide with each car moving in the other direction. So, the number of collisions is n*n = n^2.

    return n**2

start of this response: 
Each car moving from left to right will collide exactly once with a car moving from right to left. Since there are n cars moving in each direction, there will be n collisions. Therefore, the function returns n. 

Here is the Python code:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    return n
```
